# Boilerplate for TypeScript and React Project

Boilerplate for using TypeScript (TS) with React with a small web server. Ideal for testing small code in TypeScript and React (TSX).

- TypeScript
- Typings/@Types
- Webpack to build 
- Webpack to bundle (one vendor, one app, one lazy load)
- Webpack to start ExpressJs web server
- Importing third-party (JS) and use in TS
- Modules import + lazy load module
- ~~Server with watcher + autoreload~~
- React with TypeScript (TSX)
- Use CommonJs (instead of AMD)
